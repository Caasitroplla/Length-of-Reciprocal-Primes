# Length-of-Reciprocal-Primes
Finds how many digits in the reciprocal of a prime until it repeats.

This works by finding the nearest whole number that less than the remainder yet the greatest multiple of the prime number, and finds the length of the array of those values - 1.

Simply run `main.py` then look at your results in `data.json`.
